# GarageDoorFix

A plugin which fixes a bug with the garage door on Experimentation.

## Explanation

On Experimentation, there is a garage door in front of the main entrance with a 3% chance to drop every time it is walked under. This can trigger multiple times, and in the event that it does, the player cannot exit the building through the main entrance; they need to use the Fire Exit, which may be inaccessible due to locked doors, causing a softlock.
